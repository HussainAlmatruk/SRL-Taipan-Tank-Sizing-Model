## Project Purpose

The purpose of this model is to determine the optimal dimensions, materials, and mass of our LOX, Jet-A, and Nitrogen pressurant tanks. It takes fundamental engine and vehicle parameters as inputs and calculates a full vehicle mass budget and key performance metrics.

## Guiding Philosophy

Our approach is **"Calculate, Don't Assume."** The script is designed to derive as much information as possible from a small set of core inputs. For example, we input the engine's thrust and efficiency (`Isp`), and the code calculates the required propellant mass not the other way around. This ensures that our design choices are directly tied to performance requirements.

## Rocket Sizing Script

A modular MATLAB script for rocket propulsion system sizing and performance calculations.

## Script Structure

The script is organized into sequential blocks for clear organization and maintainability:

- **`%% 0.0 - SETUP & CONSTANTS`**: Clears the workspace and defines universal physical constants
- **`%% 1.0 - INPUTS`**: All primary design choices, material properties, and assumptions are defined here. This is the only section that should be modified for new trade studies
- **`%% 2.0 - CALCULATIONS`**: (WORK IN PROGRESS) This section will contain all the engineering equations. It is currently a placeholder and needs to be filled in
- **`%% 3.0 - OUTPUTS`**: (WORK IN PROGRESS) This section will display the final results in a clean, formatted summary

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Pull**: Before starting work, open GitHub Desktop and Pull the latest version to ensure you are up-to-date
2. **Edit Inputs**: Open the `.m` file in MATLAB. Modify the variables in the `%% INPUTS` section as needed. currently this file is "tank sizing script.m"
3. **Add Calculations**: Implement the necessary formulas in the `%% CALCULATIONS` section
4. **Run & Analyze**: Execute the script and review the results
5. **Commit & Push**: Save your changes, go to GitHub Desktop, Commit them with a clear message, and Push them to the repository
